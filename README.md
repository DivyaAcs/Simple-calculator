# ðŸ§® Simple Calculator in Python

This is a basic command-line calculator created using Python. It performs:

- âœ… Arithmetic operations: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulo  
- âœ… Logarithmic calculation using `math.log10()`
- âœ… Trigonometric functions: sin, cos, tan (input in degrees)

---

## ðŸ”§ Features

- User inputs two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`)
- Safe handling of division by zero
- Option to calculate:
  - Log base 10 of a number
  - Trigonometric values (sin, cos, tan)
- Uses Pythonâ€™s built-in `math` module

## ðŸ’» How to Run

1. Make sure Python is installed (Python 3.x recommended)
2. Save the code in a file named `calculator.py`
3. Open terminal or command prompt
4. Run the file:

```bash
python calculator.py
